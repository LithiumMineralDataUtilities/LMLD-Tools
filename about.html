            <h2 class="section-title">Networks</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to the Lithium Mineral Locality Database Network Analysis, where subsets of our database are displayed as networks. Rather than discerning data patterns in table format, these networks connect 
                minerals to their features creating an interconnected web whereby the density and sparseness of intersections provide interesting analysis. Each network represents a locality containing one or more 
                lithium-bearing minerals except for the first network titled "Lithium Minerals." 
           </p>
          <p>
                Our networks consist of nodes and edges. Primary nodes are always named minerals, while secondary and tertiary nodes may be chemical elements, valence elements,
              mineral formulas, structural groups, or paragenetic modes. The different node types are distinguishable from one another by their shapes. Edges are the individual
              strands connecting related nodes. A mineral's oldest known age is represented by its relative size and can be found by hovering over its node. A unique node color displays the crystal system associated
            with a given mineral.
